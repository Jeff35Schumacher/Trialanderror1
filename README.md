Testing out how to make a repository for work.

This is the first file I've put on GITHUB.  It's just this text file and uninteresting.

I mean, I put a creative commons liscence on it just to see how that works.  But it's
not like I put any IP in this basic text doccument.  Sorry if that is boring.

v0.001 created file and added licensing 3/2/2022.
v0.002 added this readme file as it's first update 3/2/2022.
